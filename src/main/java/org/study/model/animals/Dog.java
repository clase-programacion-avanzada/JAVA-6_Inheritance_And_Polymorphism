/*
* Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
* It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
* The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
* When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class.
* Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
* Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship, also known as a parent-child relationship.
